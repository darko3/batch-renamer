A script written in Python 2.7 to automatically rename files in a folder with the specified name ending with incrementing numbers.

## Requirements
**Note: I will compile the binary / executable files for Windows and Linux very soon, so you don't need to have Python 2.7 installed anymore.**
* Python 2.7
* A Linux or Windows Operating System
